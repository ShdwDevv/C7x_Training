* Analog Signal :  It is continuous signal , which means it has continuous current and voltage than can very over time
* ADC : Analog to Digital Convertor is used to convert the analog signal into digital signal this is because computer and other digital system can only read digital data . It contains Sampling, quantization, and encoding .
* DSP : It used some algorithm to manipulate and improve the digital signal which is converted by the ADC . It contains Filtering, enhancement, compression
* Transducer : Converts one form of enery into another form of energy
### What is DSP
* Digital Signal processing is used to read the digital signal for improving the feature or get essential feature
* It is used in audio processsing , medical processing and control system
* It have the capability to differentiate normal and noise signal and it wont give the perfect result

### Why digital signal is better than Analog Signal
* It produce less affected by noise which uses the discrete signal so that we can easily differentiate the values in noise environment
* Digital Signal have the quantization error which is much typically smaller than the error in analog signal

### Uses of DSP processor
* When we convert analog signal to the digital signale we got some noise error , To correct this we use DSP processor 
* To impreve the wuality of this signale it contains various techniques like filtering , smoothening .

### Uses of DSP in Audio
* DSP used in music company to impove the music quality and generate new sounds
* Noise reduction is dont by having a noise gate which have some threshold values,it if any of the value os below the threshold then we reject the signal which is noise
* Equalization is used to modify the signal's frequency response to enhance the audio quality
* Compression is used to reduce the audio size which takes less time to transmission
* Pitch correlation usid to produce the particulare sound effect 

### Components of DSP processor
* DSP is a hardward structure because it have seperate memory space for instruction and data and also it need to do some processes in parallel which von neuman can't do
* DSP is a real time signal processing so we have deterministic and low latency we need
* The components are
    * Program Memory : This contains all the program 
    * Data Memory : This contains the data
    * Compute Engine : This is the heart of DSP used to execute the instruction from the Program memory and execute the data from data memory
    * Input/Output : This contains all the outside components

### Digital Signal Processing System
![alt text](dsp1.png)
* First it will take the input form transducer device (microphone) and the electriccal signal is send into the op-amp which improve the amplitude of the signal and then pass into the antialiasing filer
* Antialiasing filter used to eliminate the higher frequency by having the threshold rate this is because we want a signal lesser than the half of the sampling frequency
* The filtered signal is passed into the ADC which converts the Analog to Digital Signal and converted into bits 
* By that data we can do the performance and analyse the data through DSP processor anf then it is send to DAC 
* And we use Low pass filter to remove the unwanted higher frequency signal and smootehn the signal
* With the help of Op-Amp that has output transducer ie Speaker


### My doubts
* Why frequency domain is better than the time domain 
* use of op-Amp
